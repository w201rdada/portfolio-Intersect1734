## The Struggle for League Coordinators.
Youth sports offer a unique opportunity for young athletes to learn focus, dedication, and sportsmanship. These lessons are best taught through a well-balanced season, where players can experience both the reward of victory and the character-building that comes with defeat. It is often difficult to build balanced teams within a league, though, and one team may finish undefeated while another loses every single game. This imbalance may seem like a small issue or one that is overly obsessed with "fairness", but even an advocate for free competition can't ignore the consequences. An ESPN survey in 2013 revealed that the top reason players quit youth sports is because they do not have fun.^[Kelley, Bruce and Carl Carchia. "Hidden Demographics of Youth Sports". *ESPN Magazine*. Published 11 July 2013. http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/9469252/hidden-demographics-youth-sports-espn-magazine] With even competition being an integral part of enjoyment, the issue of team balance in youth sports leagues is absolutely critical to attrition.

###SH: I appreciate the idea of using professional-level analytics in an amatuer setting. 

Unfortunately, volunteer coordinators for recreational leagues are simply not equipped for this challenge. They have limited information, no tools, and short time frames to create teams. This project aims to better equip them by bringing the sports analytics revolution from the professional arena to youth leagues. The player assessment and team selection algorithms developed here will be game-changers in helping league coordinators create balanced seasons with competitive games. Ultimately, this will result in more lifelong athletes.


## Sports Analytics Tailored for Youth.
This project will take on two primary challenges: player evaluation and team composition.

###SH:Utilizing off-court metrics is can be a challenge, but in my opinion very critical. I like how you mentioned number of siblings, not many people realise how much having a sibling can increase your athletic ability, especially for younger siblings. 

First, the analysis will determine which statistics best capture a young basketball player's skill level. Traditional metrics such as *height* and *lay-ups made in 1 minute* will be weighed against less obvious factors such as *number of siblings in the league* and *birth month*. Using player descriptions and game result data from previous seasons of local youth basketball programs, the project will explore variable relationships and uncover non-intuitive critical metrics. A small set of evaluation criteria will be put forward as the most critical, and some method of combining those metrics will be proposed to create a single-value "skill score".

###SH: This system will prevent teams from drafting certain players if it proves to be unfair?

With that knowledge, the project will then create a hypothetical player population and evaluate common team selection techniques. A "draft" model (with turns taken around a table) will be compared to various algorithmic methods to determine which results in the most evenly skilled teams. A "random selection" model will be used as a baseline, to ensure that any proposed selection process results in some increase to equality.

###SH I really like this idea. More even teams will equate to more fun and learning for these young athletes. I think as we learn more data science principles, this is a project that could be implemented. 
## Athletes for Life.
The two studies described above will combine to offer a revolutionary total solution to league coordinators: advice on what player metrics to capture and how to translate those measurements into team assignments. There will be limitations, of course. Unavailable player and game data (due to privacy concerns or incomplete record keeping) may hinder the analysis, and league coordinators may be unable to implement the suggested evaluation methods. Even in a limited form, though, this project will improve the balance of teams so that young players can be introduced to basketball in an engaging and enjoyable way. The season's losses will be balanced by the satisfaction that comes with competition, and athletes will learn dedication and focus. Most importantly, they will be more likely to return to the court in subsequent seasons.
