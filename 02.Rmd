## Move More - But How?

In recent years, Americans have collectively been given the mandate to "be more active". We are constantly reminded that walking more helps combat heart disease, and that obesity is among the top killers in this country. In a genuine effort to change their habits, many people have purchased a fitness watch or other step counter. Companies such as Fitbit and Garmin offer fitness bands that promise [actionable insights](https://connect.garmin.com/en-US/features/insights) for users. However, these insights need significant improvement.

Above is a real screenshot of a Garmin Connect Insight's page. The app suggests that I take the stairs and park further from my door in order to increase my activity on Fridays. These are fair suggestions if the goal is merely to increase step count. However, without activity **enjoyment** as a criteria, it is a slippery slope from these suggestions into more eclectic and ridiculous options for increased step count: office chairs being replaced by [yoga balls](https://officechairadvisor.com/yoga-ball-office-chair/) or [treadmills](https://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-treadmill-desks/), for example.  

The discussion above raises three points: (1) fitness band users are desperate to increase their activity levels, (2) they have no idea how to do it, and (3) current fitness apps are not offering helpful suggestions. Consider the average user of a fitness band. He is not a regular gym goer or a professional nutritionist; he is a working professional with a desk job and a fear of heart disease. To really change his habits, he needs an app that will walk him through choices towards a more active life. This must be more than a suggestion to take the stairs; he needs to be excited about his new approach to fitness. Here, an app is proposed that offers fitness band users a better way to achieve their step goals -- through **enjoyable** activities. This is undoubtedly the route to real life change.


## Using Your Data To Make Fitness Fun 


The app proposed here will be at the intersection of Fitbit and Meetup. It will analyze a user's movement statistics, then suggest activities and social groups to encourage the user to move more. Nearby events and challenges will be brought to the user's attention - making it easy for him to make the right choice to be more active - and social network functionalities will be used to provide peer encouragement and support.

![*Examples of suggested activities*](figures\figure02.jpg)  

The app works in three stages:  

1. By analyzing the user's fitness band data, the app characterizes habits, strengths, and struggles. It determines which days and times the user is most active, and which days have grown more inactive. It also determines the user's physical capabilities: max speed, duration, and distance.  

2. The app then searches through a database of known activities and suggests those that fit the user. Activities of a similar duration and intensity are offered, alongside some of increased intensity (~10%) as a "challenge".  For example, a user that has completed a 3-mile hike every Saturday for the last month may be challenged to complete a nearby 4-mile hike, while a user with minimal activity history may see a suggestion for a 0.5-mile walking tour of the botanical gardens.  

3. Finally, the app searches the user's social network to find a suitable workout buddy. Friends with similar activity profiles (uration, distance, and frequency) are matched and offered an appropriate adventure for the pair to explore together.  

Eventually, the app's functionality could be expanded by offering suggested hobbies or excursions. This feature would consider the activities a user has logged regularly, and attempt to introduce a new hobby based on combinations seen in other users. For example, data analysis may reveal that 80% of users logging a hike every Saturday also log a snowshoeing trip at least once in December. An avid hiker would then be prompted with a suggestion in December - "Why not give showshoeing a try?" Perhaps a Groupon for a guided showshoeing adventure could accompany the suggestion.


## A Real Action Plan

Good intentions must be accompanied by an action plan.
