Abstract: Data-driven Team Selection in Youth Basketball Youth basketbal league coordinators are ill equipped for the challenge of creating balanced teams each season. With players changing every year and many dramatically changing in skill level, the youth sports draft problem is even more complicated than professional team formation. This project aims to bring professional-level sports analytics to the youth level, so that coordinators can create better games, balanced seasons, and ultimately more lifelong athletes. Abstract: A Fitness App That Takes Initiative Fitness band companies such as Fitbit or Garmin promise to offer “actionable insights” that help users be more active. However, they have not delivered on that promise. Currently, the best advice available to the average app user is to “take the stairs” and “walk more”. That is no way to inspire lasting life change. Instead, apps must work with each user as an individual and find activities that bring enjoyment on a personal level. This project describes an app that does exactly that: we use movement data to understand a user’s habits and abilities, then offer suggestions for fun, enjoyable, and most importantly sustainable activities. With an element of social networking added for accountability, this app is sure to inspire many people in their fitness journey.

["Mini-Moneyball.html", "Data-driven Team Selection in Youth Basketball The Struggle for League Coordinators Sports Analytics Tailored for Youth Athletes for Life", " Data-driven Team Selection in Youth Basketball Keywords Youth sports, sports analytics The Struggle for League Coordinators Youth sports offer a unique opportunity for young athletes to learn focus, dedication, and sportsmanship. These lessons are best taught through a well-balanced season, where players can experience both the reward of victory and the character-building that comes with defeat. It is often difficult to build balanced teams within a league, though, and one team may finish undefeated while another loses every single game. This imbalance may seem like a small issue or one that is overly obsessed with “fairness”, but even an advocate for free competition can’t ignore the consequences. An ESPN survey in 2013 revealed that the top reason players quit youth sports is because they do not have fun.1 With even competition being an integral part of enjoyment, the issue of team balance in youth sports leagues is absolutely critical to retention. Unfortunately, volunteer coordinators for recreational leagues are simply not equipped for this challenge. They have limited player information, no tools, and short time frames to create teams. This project aims to better equip them by bringing the sports analytics revolution from the professional arena to youth leagues. The player assessment and team selection algorithms developed here will be game-changers in helping league coordinators create balanced seasons with competitive games. Ultimately, this will result in more lifelong athletes. Sports Analytics Tailored for Youth This project will take on two primary challenges: player evaluation and team composition. Player Evaluation - a data-driven “skill score” First, the analysis will determine which statistics best capture a young basketball player’s skill level. Traditional metrics such as height and lay-ups made in 1 minute will be weighed against less obvious factors such as number of siblings in the league and birth month. Player descriptions and performance data will initially be taken from previous seasons of local youth basketball programs, but the addition of family surveys for supplemental data will truly set this project apart. Particularly for sensitive information (with privacy concerns), obscure information (where record keeping may be incomplete), and “soft” metrics (such as motivation for playing), these surveys will offer more well-rounded information than has been used in the past. With information about so many aspects of a player’s identity, the project will explore the relationships between all of these variables and uncover non-intuitive critical metrics. A small set of evaluation criteria will then be put forward as the most impactful, and some method of combining those metrics will be proposed to create a single-value “skill score”. Team Composition With the “skill-score” metric defined, the project will then develop a model to associate a team’s overall composition with its performance. This will answer the classic question: can one all-star create a winning season for his team? Or are team dynamics and complementary skills the key to success? Win/loss records will be modeled as a function of mean skill, range of skill, maximum skill, and other characterizations in order to determine which is the defining statistic. Finally, the project will create a hypothetical player population and evaluate common team selection techniques and determine which results in the best team composition throughout the league. A “random selection” model will be used as a baseline, to ensure that any proposed selection process results in some increase to equality. Beyond that, a draft model (with turns taken around a table) will be compared to various algorithmic methods to determine which results in a set of fully competitive teams. Athletes for Life The two studies described above will combine to offer a revolutionary total solution to league coordinators: advice on what player metrics to capture and how to translate those measurements into team assignments. There will be limitations, of course, and league coordinators may only be able to implement a small part of the suggestions given here. Even in a limited form, though, this project will improve the balance of teams so that young players can be introduced to basketball in an engaging and enjoyable way. The season’s losses will be balanced by the satisfaction that comes with competition, and athletes will learn dedication and focus. Most importantly, they will be more likely to return to the court in subsequent seasons. Kelley, Bruce and Carl Carchia. “Hidden Demographics of Youth Sports”. ESPN Magazine.

Using Your Data To Make Fitness Fun A Real Action Plan", " A Fitness App That Takes Initiative! {#Meetup Fitness} Keywords Fitness, App, Fitbit, Garmin, Step tracking Move More - But How? In recent years, Americans have collectively been given the mandate to “be more active”. We are constantly reminded that walking more helps combat heart disease, and that obesity is among the top killers in this country. In a genuine effort to change their habits, many people have purchased a fitness watch or other step counter. Companies such as Fitbit and Garmin offer fitness bands that promise actionable insights for users. However, these insights need significant improvement. I have been wearing the Garmin Vivofit 3 fitness watch for the last 1 year. Below is a real screenshot of my Garmin Connect Insights page: Screenshot of the Garmin Insight page. Notice the advice to “Just keep moving!”, followed by articles that reinforce the “take more steps” mandate. With 6 months of data on my walking, sleep, and activity, the insights that the app suggested were to “take the stairs” and “park further away”. These were quite a disappointment: totally generic suggestions not tailored to me at all. They worked in the short term, but did not last very long as lifestyle changes. Eventually, the hassle of the stairs overruled my abstract desire to be “more fit”, and I fell back to the lazy weekends that I enjoyed. I eventually did find the motivation to walk more, but it came from an unexpected place: I adopted a dog. My 1 year old puppy, Flick, needs many miles of walking every day, and I have been obliging. There are certainly times that I feel tired or lazy, but my desire to treat Flick well overrules my excuses. The trick, I have found, is that I am truly enjoying the walking. I enjoy working with my dog, and I love seeing the excitement from him. I genuinely look forward to our outings now, and it has kept me active throughout the summer and even now, into the dreary Seattle winter. My failed attempt at fitness through Garmin and then my success with Flick brought a realization: successful fitness comes when being active is made enjoyable. Here, my team proposes a fitness app that brings that approach to all users. We create helpful and specific suggestions by using data to transform the generic idea of “walking more” into personally targeted challenges. These challenges build a physical adventure to go alongside each user’s fitness journey, and ultimately create long-lasting habits. Using Your Data To Make Fitness Fun Our app is at the intersection of Fitbit and Meetup. It analyzes a user’s movement statistics, then suggests activities and social groups to encourage the user to move more. For example, the app may offer suggestions like the ones below: Examples of suggested activities The app works in three stages: By analyzing the user’s fitness band data, the app characterizes habits, strengths, and struggles. It determines which days and times the user is most active, and which days see less movement. It also determines the user’s physical capabilities: max speed, duration, and distance. The app then searches through a database of known activities and suggests those that fit the user. Activities of achievable duration and intensity are offered, alongside some of increased intensity (~10%) as a “challenge”. For example, a user that has completed a 3-mile hike every Saturday for the last month may be challenged to complete a nearby 4-mile hike, while a user with minimal activity history may see a suggestion for a 0.5-mile walking tour of the botanical gardens. Finally, the app searches the user’s social network to find a suitable workout buddy. Friends with similar activity profiles (duration, distance, and frequency) are matched and offered an appropriate adventure for the pair to explore together. Eventually, the app’s functionality could be expanded by offering suggested hobbies or excursions. This feature would consider the activities a user has logged regularly, and attempt to introduce a new hobby based on combinations seen in other users. For example, data analysis may reveal that 80% of users logging a hike every Saturday also log a snowshoeing trip at least once in December. An avid hiker would then be prompted with a suggestion in December - “Why not give showshoeing a try?” Perhaps a Groupon for a guided showshoeing adventure could accompany the suggestion. In summary, the app suggests activities that strike the balance between achievability and challenge, and uses social networking to keep users on track with their goals. A Real Action Plan Relentless marketing has finally begun to convince the American public that fitness is important, and that moving more each day is one key to remaining healthy. The fitness band market has grown incredibly, fueled by people who geuinely want to make a change to their lives. Those good intentions deserve to be met with an action plan. Our app promises to give that level of direction to the average person’s fitness journey. It uses data science to find activities that would suit a user, and embraces social networking by using friends to encourage people to stick with their goals. Of course, no app can promise results. But this program brings together new elements that would certainly help the cause. "]
